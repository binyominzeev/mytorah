Why do you act alone, while all the people stand about you from morning until evening?” <strong>15.</strong> Moses replied to his father-in-law, “It is because the people come to me to inquire of God. <strong>16.</strong> When they have a dispute, it comes before me, and I decide between one party and another, and I make known the laws and teachings of God.” <strong>17.</strong> But Moses’ father-in-law said to him, “The thing you are doing is not right; <strong>18.</strong> you will surely wear yourself out, and these people as well. For the task is too heavy for you; you cannot do it alone. <strong>19.</strong> Now listen to me. I will give you counsel, and God be with you! You represent the people before God: you bring the disputes before God, <strong>20.</strong> and enjoin upon them the laws and the teachings, and make known to them the way they are to go and the practices they are to follow. <strong>21.</strong> You shall also seek out, from among all the people, capable individuals. who fear God—trustworthy ones who spurn ill-gotten gain. Set these over them as chiefs of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens, and <strong>22.</strong> let them judge the people at all times. Have them bring every major dispute to you, but let them decide every minor dispute themselves. Make it easier for yourself by letting them share the burden with you. <strong>23.</strong> If you do this—and God so commands you—you will be able to bear up; and all these people too will go home unwearied.” <strong>24.</strong> Moses heeded his father-in-law and did just as he had said. <strong>25.</strong> Moses chose capable individuals out of all Israel, and appointed them heads over the people—chiefs of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens; <strong>26.</strong> and they judged the people at all times: the difficult matters they would bring to Moses, and all the minor matters they would decide themselves. <strong>27.</strong> Then Moses bade his father-in-law farewell, and he went his way to his own land.</p></td></tr>

Israel encamped there in front of the mountain, <strong>3.</strong> and Moses went up to God. Hashem called to him from the mountain, saying, “Thus shall you say to the house of Jacob and declare to the children of Israel: <strong>4.</strong> ‘You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, how I bore you on eagles’ wings and brought you to Me. <strong>5.</strong> Now then, if you will obey Me faithfully and keep My covenant, you shall be My treasured possession among all the peoples.

Let them wash their clothes. <strong>11.</strong> Let them be ready for the third day; for on the third day Hashem will come down, in the sight of all the people, on Mount Sinai. <strong>12.</strong> You shall set bounds for the people round about, saying, ‘Beware of going up the mountain or touching the border of it. Whoever touches the mountain shall be put to death <strong>13.</strong> without being touched—by being either stoned or shot; beast or person, a trespasser shall not live.’ When the ram’s horn sounds a long blast, they may go up on the mountain.” <strong>14.</strong> Moses came down from the mountain to the people and warned the people to stay pure, and they washed their clothes. <strong>15.</strong> And he said to the people, “Be ready for the third day: [the men among] you should not go near a woman.” <strong>16.</strong> On the third day, as morning dawned, there was thunder, and lightning, and a dense cloud upon the mountain, and a very loud blast of the horn; and all the people who were in the camp trembled. <strong>17.</strong> Moses led the people out of the camp toward God, and they took their places at the foot of the mountain. <strong>18.</strong> Now Mount Sinai was all in smoke, for Hashem had come down upon it in fire; the smoke rose like the smoke of a kiln, and the whole mountain trembled violently. <strong>19.</strong> The blare of the horn grew louder and louder. As Moses spoke, God answered him in thunder. <strong>20.</strong> Hashem came down upon Mount Sinai, on the top of the mountain, and Hashem called Moses to the top of the mountain and Moses went up. <strong>21.</strong> Hashem said to Moses, “Go down, warn the people not to break through to Hashem to gaze, lest many of them perish. <strong>22.</strong> The priests also, who come near Hashem, must stay pure, lest Hashem break out against them.” <strong>23.</strong> But Moses said to Hashem, “The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai, for You warned us saying, ‘Set bounds about the mountain and sanctify it.’” <strong>24.</strong> So Hashem said to him, “Go down, and come back together with Aaron; but let not the priests or the people break through to come up to Hashem, lest [God] break out against them.” <strong>25.</strong> And Moses went down to the people and spoke to them.</p></td></tr>
