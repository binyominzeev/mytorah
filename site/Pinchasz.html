The [eligible male] descendants of the Israelites who came out of the land of Egypt were: <strong>5.</strong> Reuben, Israel’s first-born. Descendants of Reuben: [Of] Enoch, the clan of the Enochites; of Pallu, the clan of the Palluites; <strong>6.</strong> of Hezron, the clan of the Hezronites; of Carmi, the clan of the Carmites. <strong>7.</strong> Those are the clans of the Reubenites. The men enrolled came to 43,730. <strong>8.</strong> Born to Pallu: Eliab. <strong>9.</strong> The sons of Eliab were Nemuel, and Dathan and Abiram. These are the same Dathan and Abiram, chosen in the assembly, who agitated against Moses and Aaron as part of Korah’s band when they agitated against Hashem. <strong>10.</strong> Whereupon the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up with Korah—when that band died, when the fire consumed the two hundred and fifty men—and they became an example. <strong>11.</strong> The sons of Korah, however, did not die. <strong>12.</strong> Descendants of Simeon by their clans: Of Nemuel, the clan of the Nemuelites; of Jamin, the clan of the Jaminites; of Jachin, the clan of the Jachinites; <strong>13.</strong> of Zerah, the clan of the Zerahites; of Saul, the clan of the Saulites. <strong>14.</strong> Those are the clans of the Simeonites; [men enrolled: ] 22,200. <strong>15.</strong> Descendants of Gad by their clans: Of Zephon, the clan of the Zephonites; of Haggi, the clan of the Haggites; of Shuni, the clan of the Shunites; <strong>16.</strong> of Ozni, the clan of the Oznites; of Eri, the clan of the Erites; <strong>17.</strong> of Arod, the clan of the Arodites; of Areli, the clan of the Arelites. <strong>18.</strong> Those are the clans of Gad’s descendants; men enrolled: 40,500. <strong>19.</strong> Born to Judah: Er and Onan. Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. <strong>20.</strong> Descendants of Judah by their clans: Of Shelah, the clan of the Shelanites; of Perez, the clan of the Perezites; of Zerah, the clan of the Zerahites. <strong>21.</strong> Descendants of Perez: of Hezron, the clan of the Hezronites; of Hamul, the clan of the Hamulites. <strong>22.</strong> Those are the clans of Judah; men enrolled: 76,500. <strong>23.</strong> Descendants of Issachar by their clans: [Of] Tola, the clan of the Tolaites; of Puvah, the clan of the Punites; <strong>24.</strong> of Jashub, the clan of the Jashubites; of Shimron, the clan of the Shimronites. <strong>25.</strong> Those are the clans of Issachar; men enrolled: 64,300. <strong>26.</strong> Descendants of Zebulun by their clans: Of Sered, the clan of the Seredites; of Elon, the clan of the Elonites; of Jahleel, the clan of the Jahleelites. <strong>27.</strong> Those are the clans of the Zebulunites; men enrolled: 60,500. <strong>28.</strong> The sons of Joseph were Manasseh and Ephraim—by their clans. <strong>29.</strong> Descendants of Manasseh: Of Machir, the clan of the Machirites.—Machir begot Gilead.—Of Gilead, the clan of the Gileadites. <strong>30.</strong> These were the descendants of Gilead: [Of] Iezer, the clan of the Iezerites; of Helek, the clan of the Helekites; <strong>31.</strong> [of] Asriel, the clan of the Asrielites; [of] Shechem, the clan of the Shechemites; <strong>32.</strong> [of] Shemida, the clan of the Shemidaites; [of] Hepher, the clan of the Hepherites.— <strong>33.</strong> Now Zelophehad son of Hepher had no sons, only daughters. The names of Zelophehad’s daughters were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.— <strong>34.</strong> Those are the clans of Manasseh; men enrolled: 52,700. <strong>35.</strong> These are the descendants of Ephraim by their clans: Of Shuthelah, the clan of the Shuthelahites; of Becher, the clan of the Becherites; of Tahan, the clan of the Tahanites. <strong>36.</strong> These are the descendants of Shuthelah: Of Eran, the clan of the Eranites. <strong>37.</strong> Those are the clans of Ephraim’s descendants; men enrolled: 32,500. Those are the descendants of Joseph by their clans. <strong>38.</strong> The descendants of Benjamin by their clans: Of Bela, the clan of the Belaites; of Ashbel, the clan of the Ashbelites; of Ahiram, the clan of the Ahiramites; <strong>39.</strong> of Shephupham, the clan of the Shuphamites; of Hupham, the clan of the Huphamites. <strong>40.</strong> The sons of Bela were Ard and Naaman: [Of Ard,] the clan of the Ardites; of Naaman, the clan of the Naamanites. <strong>41.</strong> Those are the descendants of Benjamin by their clans; men enrolled: 45,600. <strong>42.</strong> These are the descendants of Dan by their clans: Of Shuham, the clan of the Shuhamites. Those are the clans of Dan, by their clans. <strong>43.</strong> All the clans of the Shuhamites; men enrolled: 64,400. <strong>44.</strong> Descendants of Asher by their clans: Of Imnah, the clan of the Imnites; of Ishvi, the clan of the Ishvites; of Beriah, the clan of the Beriites. <strong>45.</strong> Of the descendants of Beriah: Of Heber, the clan of the Heberites; of Malchiel, the clan of the Malchielites.— <strong>46.</strong> The name of Asher’s daughter was Serah.— <strong>47.</strong> These are the clans of Asher’s descendants; men enrolled: 53,400. <strong>48.</strong> Descendants of Naphtali by their clans: Of Jahzeel, the clan of the Jahzeelites; of Guni, the clan of the Gunites; <strong>49.</strong> of Jezer, the clan of the Jezerites; of Shillem, the clan of the Shillemites. <strong>50.</strong> Those are the clans of the Naphtalites, clan by clan; men enrolled: 45,400. <strong>51.</strong> This is the enrollment of the Israelite men: 601,730. <strong>52.</strong> Hashem spoke to Moses, saying, <strong>53.</strong> “Among these shall the land be apportioned as shares, according to the listed names: <strong>54.</strong> with larger groups increase the share, with smaller groups reduce the share. Each is to be assigned its share according to its enrollment. <strong>55.</strong> The land, moreover, is to be apportioned by lot; and the allotment shall be made according to the listings of their ancestral tribes. <strong>56.</strong> Each portion shall be assigned by lot, whether for larger or smaller groups.” <strong>57.</strong> This is the enrollment of the Levites by their clans: Of Gershon, the clan of the Gershonites; of Kohath, the clan of the Kohathites; of Merari, the clan of the Merarites. <strong>58.</strong> These are the clans of Levi: The clan of the Libnites, the clan of the Hebronites, the clan of the Mahlites, the clan of the Mushites, the clan of the Korahites.—Kohath begot Amram. <strong>59.</strong> The name of Amram’s wife was Jochebed daughter of Levi, who was born to Levi in Egypt; she bore to Amram Aaron and Moses and their sister Miriam. <strong>60.</strong> To Aaron were born Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. <strong>61.</strong> Nadab and Abihu died when they offered alien fire before Hashem.— <strong>62.</strong> Their enrollment of 23,000 comprised all males from a month up. They were not part of the regular enrollment of the Israelites, since no share was assigned to them among the Israelites. <strong>63.</strong> These are the males enrolled by Moses and Eleazar the priest who registered the Israelites on the steppes of Moab, at the Jordan near Jericho. <strong>64.</strong> Among these there was not one of those enrolled by Moses and Aaron the priest when they recorded the Israelites in the wilderness of Sinai. <strong>65.</strong> For Hashem had said of them, “They shall die in the wilderness.” Not one of them survived, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun. <strong>66.</strong> Porque Hashem tinha dito deles: Certamente morrerão no deserto; e não restou homem algum deles, exceto Calev, filho de Yefuneh, e Yehoshua, filho de Nun. {ס}</p></td></tr>

The names of the daughters were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. <strong>2.</strong> They stood before Moses, Eleazar the priest, the chieftains, and the whole assembly, at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, and they said, <strong>3.</strong> “Our father died in the wilderness. He was not one of the faction, Korah’s faction, which banded together against Hashem, but died for his own sin; and he has left no sons. <strong>4.</strong> Let not our father’s name be lost to his clan just because he had no son! Give us a holding among our father’s kinsmen!” <strong>5.</strong> Moses brought their case before Hashem. <strong>6.</strong> And Hashem said to Moses, <strong>7.</strong> “The plea of Zelophehad’s daughters is just: you should give them a hereditary holding among their father’s kinsmen; transfer their father’s share to them. <strong>8.</strong> “Further, speak to the Israelite people as follows: ‘If a householder. dies without leaving a son, you shall transfer his property to his daughter. <strong>9.</strong> If he has no daughter, you shall assign his property to his brothers. <strong>10.</strong> If he has no brothers, you shall assign his property to his father’s brothers. <strong>11.</strong> If his father had no brothers, you shall assign his property to his nearest relative in his own clan, who shall inherit it.’ This shall be the law of procedure for the Israelites, in accordance with Hashem’s command to Moses.” <strong>12.</strong> Hashem said to Moses, “Ascend these heights of Abarim and view the land that I have given to the Israelite people. <strong>13.</strong> When you have seen it, you too shall be gathered to your kin, just as your brother Aaron was. <strong>14.</strong> For, in the wilderness of Zin, when the community was contentious, you disobeyed My command to uphold My sanctity in their sight by means of the water.” Those are the Waters of Meribath-kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin. <strong>15.</strong> Moses spoke to Hashem, saying, <strong>16.</strong> “Let Hashem, Source of the breath of all flesh, appoint someone over the community <strong>17.</strong> who shall go out before them and come in before them, and who shall take them out and bring them in, so that Hashem’s community may not be like sheep that have no shepherd.” <strong>18.</strong> And Hashem answered Moses, “Single out Joshua son of Nun, an inspired man, and lay your hand upon him. <strong>19.</strong> Have him stand before Eleazar the priest and before the whole community, and commission him in their sight. <strong>20.</strong> Invest him with some of your authority, so that the whole Israelite community may obey. <strong>21.</strong> But he shall present himself to Eleazar the priest, who shall on his behalf seek the decision of the Urim before Hashem. By such instruction they shall go out and by such instruction they shall come in, he and all the Israelite [militia], and the whole community.” <strong>22.</strong> Moses did as Hashem commanded him.
